# Automatic-Waterlevel-Indicator
 There is a large quantity of water wastage from overhead tanks, especially in big buildings like apartments, offices, hostels, etc., there is no proper invigilation of the water level in tanks once the motor is turned on. Also emptying of the tank is not known prior and hence adiscomfort is created when the water is needed for emergency.
 The Framework provided in this project detects the level of water in tanks using ultrasonic sensors and sends message to the mobile of the operator at the earliest.
 Ultrasonic sensor fixed at top of the tank, will be detecting the waterlevels and when checkpoints are encountered it will  output that to the Arduino Uno.Arduino will be inturn interfaced with a GSM(Global System for mobile Communications) which will send  a text message to the operator about the current waterlevel status.
 
The following components/technologies are used during this project:

1.Arduino UNO( https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction )

2.GSM SIM900 Module(supports communication in 900MHz band)

3.Ultrasonic Sensor

4.Jumper Wires
   
5.Power Supply
